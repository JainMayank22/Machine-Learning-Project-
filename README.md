Car detection and classification:
Explored YOLOv3 and VGG16 in-depth for car detection and model classification tasks on this dataset:https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/stanford-cars-dataset.
Conducted various image data preprocessing such as edge detection, gaussian blur, denoise, image segmentation, and other methods. 
Implemented a neural network pipeline where YOLOv3 passes object (car) detected bounding box to VGG16 for car model prediction from 196 car classes. Applied transfer learning on the VGG16 model for the task and achieved 99% accuracy on the test and validation set with 100 epochs.
